# Import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt

# Print the first 10 rev_results

#### ORDERING BY MULTIPLE COLUMNS
# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state, desc(census.columns.age))

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 20 results
print(results[:20])
